## 🎨 Customization

### 1. Font

This chart uses **EB Garamond** for a bookish, soft feel. Make sure `EBGaramond-Regular.ttf` is in your working directory.

> Don’t have it? Download it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) and place it next to the script.

### 2. Background Image

The watercolor texture should be named `watercolor_bg.png` and placed in the same directory as the script.

> Replace it with any image of your choice — just keep the same filename or adjust the script accordingly.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python ghibli_bar_chart.py
```

This will render a bar chart titled, with a soft visual style and a handcrafted touch.
